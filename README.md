# 📈 Regression — Concepts Explained Simply

## 📖 Overview  
This repository is dedicated to **understanding Regression concepts in the simplest way possible** — starting from hands-on **Excel demonstrations** and later expanding into **Python and real-world projects**.

The goal is to make regression approachable for beginners by visually showing how relationships between variables work, and how models like **Linear Regression**, **Multiple Regression**, and others actually behave in practice.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Explain regression intuitively using **Excel**.  
- Demonstrate the math and logic behind regression (slope, intercept, R²).  
- Visualize regression lines and prediction trends.  
- Extend to Python-based regression projects later.
