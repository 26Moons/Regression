Linear Regression is a supervised machine-learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X).
It assumes that this relationship can be represented using a straight line, making it one of the simplest and most widely used statistical methods.

In simple terms:

Linear regression finds the best-fit straight line through your data that minimizes the total error between actual values and predicted values.

These differences between observed values (Y) and predicted values (Ŷ) are called errors or residuals.

📘 Example

Suppose you are analyzing Study Hours (X) vs Exam Scores (Y).

Hours	Score
2	50
4	65
5	70
7	85
8	88

Linear regression will try to fit a straight line that best predicts the score from the hours studied.
